    <h2>About the Website</h2>

    <p>This website is dedicated to providing in-depth tutorials and resources on the <strong>Yocto
            Project</strong>, guiding developers from beginner to advanced levels. Whether you are just
        starting
        with embedded Linux development or looking to master <strong>custom Linux distributions using
            Yocto</strong>, this platform offers a structured learning path with <strong>practical examples,
            step-by-step guides, and real-world use cases</strong>.</p>

    <p>In addition to written tutorials, you can also find video explanations on my <strong>YouTube channel,<a
                href="http://www.youtube.com/@techabyte8"> Tech-A-Byte</a></strong>, where
        I demonstrate Yocto concepts with hands-on examples. These videos complement the website tutorials, making it
        easier to grasp complex topics visually.</p>

    <h3>Mission & Vision</h3>

    <p>The mission of this website is to <strong>simplify embedded Linux development</strong> and help
