    <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to add packages to your Yocto-based image. You will discover how to check if
        a package is available in your layers, add it to your Yocto build, build the image with the added package, and
        verify if the package is installed on the target device.</p><br>
    <p>
        Now before adding a package to your Yocto image, you need to check if the package is available in your layers.
        This tutorial will guide you through finding, adding, and verifying packages in your Yocto build.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Find Packages</h3>
    <p>
        To find a package, you first need to set up your build environment. Follow these steps:
    </p>
    <p>
        Navigate to your <code>poky</code> folder. Now source the build environment using the following command:
        <pre><code>source oe-init-build-env</code></pre>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the environment is set up, you can use the following commands to check if a package is available:
    </p>
    <pre><code>bitbake-layers show-recipes
bitbake-layers show-recipes python3
bitbake-layers show-recipes git</code></pre>

    <h3>How to Add a Package</h3>
    <p>
        If the package is available, you can add it to your image by editing the <code>local.conf</code> file. Add the
        following line to include the package:
    </p>
    <pre><code>IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " package_name"</code></pre>
    <p>
        For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " python3"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " git"</code></pre>

    <h3>Building the Image</h3>
    <p>
        After adding the package to <code>local.conf</code>, you need to rebuild the image. Use the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>bitbake core-image-full-cmdline</code></pre>

    <h3>Verifying the Packages</h3>
    <p>
        Once the image is built, flash it to your BeagleBone Black using the steps from <strong>Tutorial 01</strong>.
        After booting the BeagleBone Black, verify that the packages are installed by running the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre><code># General syntax
# which &lt;package_name&gt;

which python
# Output: /usr/bin/python

which git
# Output: /usr/bin/git</code></pre>
    <p>
        If no output path is displayed, it means the package has not been installed.
    </p>

    <h3>Reference Link</h3>
